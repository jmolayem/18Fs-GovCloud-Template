For logs to be captured by Cloud Foundry, your application should be writing them to `STDOUT`/`STDERR`, rather than a log file â€“ see the framework-specific guidance in the menu.

## Current logs

The most direct way to view events related to your application through the deploy process is

```bash
cf logs APPNAME
```

Used alone, `cf logs` will tail the combined stream of logs from each Cloud Foundry service involved in your application deploy. Running with the `--recent` flag will stream the entire loggregator buffer for your app.

```bash
cf logs APPNAME --recent
```

### Example log

  	2015-03-16T17:37:47.82-0400 [DEA/1]      OUT Starting app instance (index 0) with guid GUID
  	2015-03-16T17:37:50.85-0400 [DEA/1]      ERR Instance (index 0) failed to start accepting connections
  	2015-03-16T17:37:53.54-0400 [API/0]      OUT App instance exited with guid GUID0 payload: {"cc_partition"=>"default", "droplet"=>"GUID0", "version"=>"GUID1", "instance"=>"GUID2", "index"=>0, "reason"=>"CRASHED", "exit_status"=>127, "exit_description"=>"failed to accept connections within health check timeout", "crash_timestamp"=>1426541870}

## Historic logs

To view and search your historic log data, visit https://logs.cloud.gov. Logs are currently retained for 180 days, and you will only see data for applications deployed within the [orgs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#orgs) and [spaces](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#spaces) where you have access.

After logging in, you will be placed into the 'App Overview' dashboard.

If you would like to change the time period of data that you are viewing, or to turn on auto-refresh, click on the time period you are currently viewing the top menu. The default time period is 'Last 15 minutes'.

We have also provided several dashboards that present different visualizations of your log data. You can select these by clicking on the 'Load Saved Dashboard' icon near the search bar.

These visualizations are provided via Kibana; you may want to [find out more about it](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html).
