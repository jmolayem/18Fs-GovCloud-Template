For applications which prefer to store their content in S3, cloud.gov provides a service which allows direct access to it.

## Plans

Plan Name | Description | Price
--------- | ----------- | -----
`basic`   | a single private bucket with unlimited storage | $0.03 / GB / month
`basic-public` | a single bucket with unlimited storage where the files are **all public** to read | $0.03 / GB / month

## How to create an instance

To create a service instance run the following command:

```bash
cf create-service s3 basic my-s3-service
```

## More Information

### Create an application only for S3

If you only need a S3 bucket, you can create a simple Static application:

```bash
mkdir s3-app
cd s3-app
touch Staticfile
cf push
```

### Add S3 to an application

Once an application is running in cloud.gov, the next step is to create and assign S3 to the application:

First decide if the S3 bucket contents should be private or public. Objects placed in a private bucket are only accessible using the bucket credentials unless specifically [shared with others](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). Objects placed in a public bucket are accessible to anyone with the link.

To create a private bucket use the `basic` plan:

```bash
cf create-service s3 basic <APP_NAME>-s3
```

To create a public bucket use the `basic-public` plan:

```bash
cf create-service s3 basic-public <APP_NAME>-s3
```

Then bind the bucket to your application:

```bash
cf bind-service <APP_NAME> <APP_NAME>-s3
cf restage <APP_NAME>
```

This will put the S3 access information in the application's ENVIRONMENT variables, which you can view with `cf env <APP_NAME>`.

If you get an error, see the [managed service documentation]({{< relref "docs/apps/managed-services.md#paid-services" >}}).

### Get S3 bucket credentials
Typically to interact with S3 the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is used.  The Amazon CLI needs the following ENVIRONMENT variables:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

These environment variables contain the credentials to access your S3 bucket. Treat the contents of these and all other environment variables as sensitive.

You can download the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) tool to get this information by pasting the below (or run `cf env` and cut and paste from it):

```bash
export APP_NAME=your-app-name-here

export S3_CREDENTIALS=`cf env $APP_NAME | tail -n +5 | jq -r '.VCAP_SERVICES.s3 // empty' 2>/dev/null`

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=`echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r .[].credentials.access_key_id`
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r .[].credentials.secret_access_key`
export BUCKET_NAME=`echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r .[].credentials.bucket`
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=`echo "${S3_CREDENTIALS}" | jq -r '.[].credentials.region // "us-east-1"'`
```

This will set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and `BUCKET_NAME`, enabling the CLI tool to add, download and modify files as needed:


```bash
# Copy a file
aws s3 cp ./mylocalfile s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/

# Download a file
aws s3 cp s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/mys3file .

# See all files
aws s3 ls s3://${BUCKET_NAME}
```

### Bucket URLs
Objects in your bucket can be accessed via the following endpoint:

* `https://s3-${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${BUCKET_NAME}/`

If you plan to enable "website mode" for the bucket and use it that way, you will need to use a different version of the URL:

* `http://${BUCKET_NAME}.s3-website-${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}.amazonaws.com/`

Note that "website mode" URLs don't support HTTPS, and they aren't appropriate for production use unless fronted by a CloudFront distribution.

Either way, if the bucket is private, attempting to access resources will result in `AccessDenied` errors unless your application generates [pre-signed URLs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) for objects that need to be shared.

### Allowing Web Access From External Applications
If users wish to access their S3 buckets from outside of their cloud.gov application then set a CORS policy, which loosens security restrictions.  This is *NOT* recommended, however with a sufficiently restricted list of sites and methods can be safe:

```bash
# Adjust CORS AllowedOrigins to known locations such as a IP address
cat << EOF > cors.json
{
  "CORSRules": [
    {
      "AllowedOrigins": ["YOUR.OTHER.APP.IP"],
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["HEAD", "GET"],
      "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

### Upload the CORS policy to the bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --cors-configuration file://cors.json
```
You can add additional method types along with HEAD and GET (such as PUT, POST, and DELETE) as needed.

### Backup and Retention
By default, S3 data will stay where it is until `cf delete-service` is run on the `<APP_NAME>-s3` service.  This however is not a substitue for backups, and provides no protection from users accidentally deleting the contents.

You can implement a backup scheme by storing your buckets under /data/year/month/day and keeping multiple copies in S3, using the aws cli. A Cloud.gov space can be created by your Organization Admin called backups, where the process above may be ran again to create "backup" buckets.
