We use the term “service” or “application” when talking about what gets deployed on cloud.gov because it is absolutely possible to deploy “non-website” services using it.

As we work with agency partners on bigger and more complex delivery projects, we will regularly evaluate whether cloud.gov is a suitable choice, and react accordingly if we find ourselves working on a system that doesn’t map easily to the PaaS model.
