### Platform as a Service (PaaS) for Government developers

cloud.gov allows your development team to focus on what matters: your applications. As a Platform as a Service (PaaS), cloud.gov **eliminates the need to manage infrastructure such as virtual machines and servers**. This enables your development team to rapidly iterate and quickly launch your application to ensure mission success. Because cloud.gov is based on **open-source technologies**, it provides portability to other cloud providers or your existing on-premise solution.

cloud.gov is developed **by the Government, for the Government**. 18F, housed within the General Services Administrationâ€™s Technology Transformation Service, develops and operates cloud.gov.

### Compliance

cloud.gov was designed with **FISMA compliance** in mind. cloud.gov is currently designated as FedRAMP Ready, and the **FedRAMP Moderate** JAB P-ATO assessment process is underway.  The vast majority of FISMA Moderate controls are managed for you. The included compliance toolkit provides assistance with generating compliance documentation, so that even small agency teams can have a quick path to ATO.
